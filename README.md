yak-setup
=========

Scripts, configurations, and other things to remember for future use.

## Quick Setup
Use the one-liner from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/theY4Kman/6197365) to automatically download and source the `.bashrc`. Replicated here:
```bash
wget https://gist.github.com/theY4Kman/6197365/raw/setup-yak.sh -O setup-yak.sh && source setup-yak.sh
```
